      At first, I thought the process of creating a website and maintaining it throughout phase zero would
      be a hinderance. After I actually worked through it incrementally then get an initial version up, it
      has actually be kind of nice to have a place to share some of what I have learned in just nine short
      weeks. Normally, I am the type of person who prefers to write things down by hand. Actually being able
      to add some styling and a different look to my content has really made me appreciate the simplicity
      behind some basic HTML and CSS.
    <p>
      That's not to say that I can't still improve it more, but I feel proud of what I have created so far.
      The list entries on my blog index page were the biggest problem. I went back in to the CSS I wrote
      during week two and realized just how much I didn't know. I was hardcoding several different margins and
      paddings just to get the elements to appear where I wanted to on my screen. I didn't test this approach
      with different screen sizes. It was lacking cleanliness and organization. I decided that I wanted to at
      least apply some better CSS to that page and fix it up. I was using positioning too liberally. I realized
      that all I needed to do were to isolate the two tables and use float with width percentages to get them
      to be symmetrical. I gave the tables captions so they could serve more as the titles for the tables as
      I intended. Before long, I made a few changes that really cleaned up the page and at least made it more
      respectable. I still cannot decide on a color scheme I like. I always default back to blues and grays.
      The next step may even be to implement a CSS framework (such as Bootstrap or Jekyll), but I almost prefer
      to use this blog to continue practicing my own HTML and CSS without having to rely on a tool.
    <p>
      I focused much more on the content of my blog. I wanted to write a useful entry each week for my tech
      blog (no matter what the length). The personal blog serves as a place to get my thoughts out in to the
      open. The most challenging part of maintaining my website has revolved around not knowing when to push
      myself to change it more and not knowing when to be satisfied with what I've created. This is something
      that I will continue to work on. Maybe after another nine weeks -- I'll have a much more professional
      blog. For now, I'm proud of what I've been able to do with it.
