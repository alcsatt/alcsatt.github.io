  <h1>Thinking About Thinking</h1>
  <h2>How Can My Style Help Me?</h2>
  <h4><em>April 5, 2015</em></h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      One of my favorite parts of the prerequisites for DBC was to learn about my thinking style.
      It's something so simple to research, but it's easy to forget about over long periods of time.
      If I'm able to remind myself of what works for me and what doesn't, then I have no doubt that
      I'll find success in this program.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are four possible results for the thinking style: concrete sequential, concrete random,
        abstract sequential and abstract random. At the end of the quiz, you get a number grade next
        to each of these styles. The one that is the highest is supposed to be your preferred thinking
        style. My results were overwhelmingly in favor of the <em>abstract</em> side. Abstract Random
        was my highest score though by far. When reading through the main points of the definition --
        I was amazed at how much I agreed with what this type of person likes to do and what this
        person struggles with:
        <ul>
          <li>Likes to listen to others</li>
          <li>Establish healthy relationships with others</li>
          <li>Learn best in a personalized environment</li>
          <li>Learn best when given broad guidelines</li>
          <li>Learn best when in group activities with friends</li>
        </ul>
        It then goes on to say that I struggle with the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Justifying and explaining feelings</li>
          <li>Competition</li>
          <li>Working with authoritarian personalities or people who aren't friendly</li>
          <li>Working on just one thing at a time</li>
          <li>Giving exact details</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I don't know what the other people in my group felt like when they took this quiz, but I
          thought it was like looking in a mirror. Some of these quizzes produce remarkably accurate
          results in just a few simple questions if you answer honestly. The above lists made me feel
          great about actually being on site at DBC because I'll be interacting with friends, experts
          and other students daily. There doesn't seem to be that toxic competitiveness associated
          with the program. Everyone is there to help and learn from each other. The biggest stuggle
          for me so far is to not be able to work face-to-face with my fellow students. This seems
          to be directly influenced by my thinking style. I don't thrive when I'm all by myself. I
          tend to get distracted or procrastinate because (as the list said), I struggle with working
          on just one thing at a time.
        </p>
        <p>One of the best ways for me to adapt and to broaden my thinking is to take Phase 0 very
          seriously. Some of the material may seem easy to me, but I need to focus more on being able
          to accomplish very specific tasks by myself. Fortunately for me, much of the Phase 0
          curriculum is already structured like that. I shouldn't be afraid to use trial-and-error to
          solve problems. I need to just dive in to something by myself and not think about it too
          much. I can really grow as a person if I just start experimenting and make adjustments going
          forward. I don't think I shy away from competition, so that is one area of abstract random
          thinking that I don't feel I struggle with. However, I don't require competition to drive me
          to do something. It's not much of an incentive for me while working on these types of
          problems.
        <p>Overall, if I can focus on knowing what my strengths already and leveraging those while
          attempting to work on my weaknesses -- I believe I will be successful in this program. Now
          is the perfect time to augment my abilities and grow not only as a student, but as a person
          in general.
