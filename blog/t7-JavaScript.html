  <h1>JavaScript vs. Ruby</h1>
  <h2>Objects and Hashes</h2>
  <h4><em>May 3, 2015</em></h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Although there are many similarities and differences between JavaScript and Ruby, I'm going to focus on
      one such comparison today: JavaScript objects versus Ruby hashes. Let's first examine how they are
      both created:<br/>
      <xmp>
        // JAVASCRIPT
          var jsObj = {}
        //

        # RUBY
          ruby_hash = {}  # Hash.new also works
        #
      </xmp>
    <p>
      Hmmm, that's not very helpful. They look the same. The only reason we can really tell what they are is
      because JavaScript has the <b>var</b> keyword while Ruby doesn't. There are also variable naming
      conventions in both languages that help to distinguish them. To continue our analysis, let's add some
      data. We could have just created both with data to begin with, or we could add some later:<br/>
      <xmp>
        // JAVASCRIPT
          var jsObj = {
            language: "JavaScript",
            age: 20
          }
          jsObj.creator = "Brendan Eich"

        # RUBY
          ruby_hash = {
            :language => "Ruby",
            :age => 20
          }
          ruby_hash[:creator] = "Yukihiro Matsumoto"
      </xmp>
    <p>
      Now we can at least see a couple differences. The pairs within JavaScript objects are called
      <b>properties</b> and <b>values</b>. The pairs within Ruby hashes are called <b>keys</b> and
      <b>values</b>. They may have slightly different syntaxes with regard to how they store data,
      but for our purposes as beginners, they are used for very similar reasons. They can group data
      together in a very efficient and organized manner. Instead of creating a list or
      individual objects with all this information, I can create one object (or hash) and store the values. I
      can then use the properties or keys to look up the data and/or change it later.
