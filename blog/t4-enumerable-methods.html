  <h1>Going Cycling</h1>
  <h2>How the #cycle method works</h2>
  <h4><em>April 12, 2015</em></h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      I've decided to try and explain a method that I've never personally used before. Even reading
      through the Ruby documentation, I'm trying to think about how this particular method would be
      useful. The <b>#cycle</b> method iterates through a collection infinitely when nothing is
      passed in as a parameter. However, when you pass in a integer, the #cycle method iterates through
      the collection that number of times. Let's say we have an array:

      <p><code>names = ["Alex", "Ben", "John", "Ralph"]</code></p>

      <p>If we say <code>names.cycle(2) {|name| puts name }</code> that would print out the following:
        <br/><br/>Alex<br/>Ben<br/>John<br/>Ralph<br/>Alex<br/>Ben<br/>John<br/>Ralph<br/>
      <p>You might wonder what this is useful for. I was thinking the same thing. Let's say you wanted to
      create a flashcard application for yourself. Almost everyone has used flashcards to quiz themselves
      at some point in their life. We might use the #cycle method to go through an entire collection of
      flashcards the number of times that we actually want to quiz ourselves so we can commit all the
      material to memory. To more properly simulate what this might be like, we can actually store an
      Enumerator in a variable:<br/><br/>
      <code>cycle_enum = names.cycle</code><br/><br/>
      Now, when we want to move on to the next element in the collection, all we need to do is call
      the enumerator's #next method:<br/><br/>
      <code>cycle_enum.next</code> #this would give us "Alex"
    </p>
    <p>
        Hopefully, this gives you some insight in to how this method works and why it can be useful!
