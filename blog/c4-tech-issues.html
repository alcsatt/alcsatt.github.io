  <h1>Becoming Obsolete</h1>
  <h2>A Business' Worst Nightmare</h2>

      When one thinks about problems facing the tech world -- my head immediately goes to security issues
      because that is where my main interests lie. Some of the biggest news stories over the last few
      years are rooted in how we're being constantly surveilled or our personal information is under
      attack. However, my goal is to focus on something that I usually don't pay attention to.
    </p>
    <p>
        The threat of becoming obsolete is something that businesses (especially in the tech world)
        constantly have to guard against or prepare for. <b><a href="http://io9.com/25-obsolete-technologies-that-future-generations-will-n-1526922030">This</a></b> article really peaked my interest in this issue. It brings up many valid examples of technologies that used to be
        standards in the tech industry, but now things have changed. I particularly liked the example
        of data storage media. The picture in the article shows the progression of floppy disks. If you
        grew up in the 1990's like me then all you really remember is the smallest floppy disk before
        it was eventually replaced by the CD. Another niche technology that the article brings up
        which were huge at the time were MP3 players. I remember when those first came out. Everyone
        though it was incredible. You could store so many songs on them and they were only a few button
        pushes away. Now, most people use their mobile phones instead of having a device dedicated to
        just playing music.
    </p>
    <p>
        I could go on about all the examples that the article brings up, but I want to bring up the real
        open question: <em>How does one avoid becoming obsolete?</em><br/>
        I don't really have an answer for that, and I'm not sure anyone else has a definitive formula
        for it either. However, there are tech companies innovating all over the world. In my opinion,
        the best way to avoid obsoletion is to keep innovating and to keep pushing yourself.
        Thinking that you have an unbeatable product or technology leads to complacency. Look at
        companies like Apple. They always seem to not only be ahead of the curve, but they set the curve.
        Their philosophy centers around encouraging different schools of thought. If everyone did things
        the same way, the world would be a pretty boring place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do I have all the answers to this? Absolutely not. I just believe it's a perpetual and pervasive
        issue that everyone must consider.
