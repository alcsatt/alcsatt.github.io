    <p>
      For this week's entry, we'll be getting in to classes in Ruby. This is perhaps one of the most
      important basic concepts for a novice programmer to understand. Classes allow you to model objects
      or processes from the real world. In technical terms, we say that a class encapsulates information
      and behavior about an object. A very generic example is so say that we have a class to represent
      a person. It might look something like this:<br/>
      <xmp>
        class Person
          attr_accessor :name, :age, :birthplace

          def initialize(name, age, birthplace)
            @name = name
            @age = age
            @birthplace = birthplace
          end

          def print_info
            puts "Name: #{@name}"
            puts "Age: #{@age}"
            puts "Birthplace: #{@birthplace}"
          end
        end

        alex = new Person("Alex", 26, "Houston, TX")
        erica = new Person("Erica", 32, "Seattle, WA")
      </xmp>
    <p>
      As you can see above, this type of construction allows me to create multiple person variables to
      represent different people. This is a powerful concept because that's exactly the way the real
      world is. Everyone is different. If I called the #print_info method on the alex object, the
      output on the screen would look like this:
      <xmp>
        Name: Alex
        Age: 26
        Birthplace: Houston, TX
      </xmp>
      <p>
      Similarly, if I called that same method on the erica object, I would get her information. This is
      all great, but I want to model something that is a little more complicated. Another passion of
      mine since I was about twelve years hold has been tennis. Anyone who has played or has tried to play
      will tell you that the scoring is not the easiest or most intuitive thing in the world. If I
      started to get in to all of it, this post would turn in to a novel. I will just be modeling what
      happens on in one GAME (trust me, it's not what you think). If you want to read more about scoring,
      you can go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis#Scoring">here.</a> To model the scoring
      in one game, I might end up with a class that looks like this:
      <xmp>
        class TennisGame

          def initialize(player1, player2)
            @player1 = player1              #this will be a name
            @player2 = player2
            @p1_pts = 0                     #this will be points won
            @p2_pts = 0
            @scores = ["Love", "15", "30", "40"]
          end

          def award_point(player)
            player == @player1? @p1_pts += 1: @p2_pts += 1
          end

          def score
            if (@p1_pts < 4 and @p2_pts < 4) and (@p1_pts + @p2_pts < 6)
              @p1_pts == @p2_pts? @scores[@p1_pts] + " All": @scores[@p1_pts] + " " + @scores[@p2_pts]
            else
              if (@p1_pts == @p2_pts)
                "Deuce"
              else
                name_to_call = @p1_pts > @p2_pts? @player1: @player2
                (@p1_pts - @p2_pts).abs == 1? "Advantage " + name_to_call: "Game " + name_to_call
              end
            end
          end

        end
      </xmp>
    <p>
      As you can see, scoring is not an easy thing to keep track of in tennis. After writing this
      class though, I won't have to worry about it. The code will keep track of it for me. All I need
      to do is know the player names and call the #point method every with that name as an argument
      every time I want to award a point to that player. Then, when I call the #score method, I'll
      always know the current score in tennis terminology. The best thing about it is that it's
      repeatable and sustainable now matter who is playing the game.
    <p>
      Hopefully this provided you with some insight as to how classes can be useful to model real
      world objects and behaviors. This could get more complicated if I wanted to actually use
      classes for the players themselves or try to model an entire tennis match to include the game
      score, the set score and the match score. This was merely an initial attempt aimed at showing
      how just a few lines of code inside a class are useful.
