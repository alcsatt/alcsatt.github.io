      This first week of Dev Bootcamp has actually gone by very quickly. I feel happier doing this work than I have been doing any work in quite a while. Even if I have seen some of the concepts covered already, I know that will not be true for long. It was great to solidify my understanding (and even gain new understanding) of topics. The command line really is awesome. I never appreciated it fully maybe because I was so used to a Windows environment. Once I got my Mac up and running, I dove right in to the command line crash course. Even the simplest things that you type can give you so much information. Anyway, let's get in to some of the concepts that we learned this week.

    <p>
        <b>Version Control</b> is something that has become increasingly associated with coding, but the high level concept of what it is applies to any type of work you could be doing. Imagine any big decision you've made in your life -- a crossroad. Right before you make that decision, let's take a snapshot. After you've made a decision, haven't you wished that you could go back to that crossroad and choose the other way? Well, that's what version control allows you to do! You can go back to that snapshot you took and it's like the bad decision never happened. As it pertains to work on projects, the idea is the same. You can go back to earlier versions of your work as long as you have committed those snapshots. This allows you to collaborate and experiment freely without the penalty of losing other work you have done. If a team member wants to work on something for your project while you work on another piece, you can do that. After you both commit your work, you can merge those changes back in to the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Git</b> is a version control tool that lives locally on your machine. A developer can use the command line to perform any operations with the repository (the place where the project is) that he is working in. Git helps you track your changes because every time you commit your work, it takes a snapshot. That snapshot has a specific ID associated with it. If it becomes necessary to revert to an earlier version of the project, that ID may be referenced and pointed to. By establishing remotes (which can be thought of as bridges), we can even push our changes to hosting sites online so other people can makes changes to our projects!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>GitHub</b> is a website that allows you to actually host your repositories online. It leverages git so it has become very popular for developers (particularly in the open source community). Hosting your repositories online gives other developers an easy way to download your work and make they own changes or fixes without actually interfering with you. By making pull requests, they might be telling you "Hey! I found a fix for a bug!" or "Hey, I have a great idea for a new feature you could add that would make this app even better!" In short, GitHub simplifies collaboration and really promotes knowledge sharing.
