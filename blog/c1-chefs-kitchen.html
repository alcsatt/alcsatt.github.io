  <h1>Dev Bootcamp Week 1</h1>
  <h2>Beginning of a New Chapter</h2>
  <h4>March 22, 2015</h4>

      This first week of Dev Bootcamp has actually gone by very quickly. I feel happier doing this work than I have been doing any work in quite a while. Even if I have seen some of the concepts covered already, I know that will not be true for long. It was great to solidify my understanding (and even gain new understanding) of topics. I started this blog the same way I started my tech blog on purpose because I still feel it's relevant.

        There is so much to learn about DBC culture, but I'm amazed at what a complete experience they have created. Not only do they have several very technically gifted people, but they have clearly gone to great lengths to get students the proper personal support network. Our Google+ group had so many posts this week of varying content. Everyone who posted was so engaged and polite and obviously has a passion for learning. I crave being around people like this on a day-to-day basis. It makes me excited to continue with this experience. At first, I was afraid because I've had a problem with not wanting to look stupid to people. I'm afraid to ask questions sometimes because I think I should be able to figure it out on my own. I do already have a Computer Science degree so I was afraid that people might wonder: "Why is this guy here? Doesn't he know what he's doing already?" I had to conquer that fear immediately, and I'm so glad I did. I posted on the Google+ group and got great feedback from people. Even this little bit of validation gave me so much confidence. I like to think that I encouraged other people who were getting frustrated as well. After all, this is only the first week in a long process. It would be easy for anyone to feel overwhelmed -- particularly if they are seeing this information for the first time.

        If I've learned anything though, it's that everyone has something to offer. It may not be raw technical ability, but everyone can add value. Everyone can learn as long as it's together. That's why I really love the "kitchen mindset" that Shereef brought up in his video. We all come in to this program with different experience, different opinions and different goals. At the end of the day though, we all have our aprons on and we're all trying to accomplish something amazing. If we all tackle these challenges together with a growth mindset, there is no way that we will be disappointed when we look back on all of this.

        The culture was really what sold me on DBC. My expectations when I first heard about the concept of a programming bootcamp were that people are probably just looking for a quick buck and not wanting to put in the amount of work it takes to get a degree. Holy moly, I could not have been more wrong. I'm starting to think this may even be more difficult than getting my degree, but more valuable too. The demands of this program are vast and perpetual. Even after the program, the learning doesn't stop. DBC points us in a direction and gives us the tools we need to succeed. We have to keep getting better as a group and use those tools. We have an obligation to share them with other people. I could not be more excited to continue with this learning process. I may stumble along the way or even get stressed out to the point where I want to quit, but if everyone is as supportive as in this first week -- I'll be just fine.
