  <h2>Giving and Receiving Feedback</h2>

    <p>
      Pairing is an integral part of this program and one that I thought I may not enjoy when I
      initially heard about it. However, my goal was always to go in with an open mind and a positive
      attitude. Hopefully, everything else would take care of itself. My very first pairing session
      was actually only with a guide during my GPS. This actually made me even more nervous, but I
      knew that I was prepared based on how much time I spent learning the material the week prior. It
      ended up going really well. She wanted me to drive the majority of the time which was completely
      understandable. I thought this would make things more difficult, but it actually provided me with
      an outlet to focus my nervous energy. After I successfully completed a few tasks, I grew more and
      more confident. She was very encouraging and even impressed with how quickly I had learned the
      material (since I had no prior experience). We even got to experiment with a few things that were
      not in the challenge.
    <p>
      The most fun I've had comes from my second GPS challenge which centered around HTML and CSS.
      We ended up joking around about how beautiful our design was and how amazing it looked when
      in reality we knew it was just a basic layout with a header, two columns for the body and a footer.
      We used easy colors for debugging our elements and I gave my pair a hard time when he took
      my horribly yellow color away from our finished product. Even the guide was having a good time. The
      most difficult time I had while pairing was in a discussion that I was not necessarily a part of.
      My pair was confused about something simple (the basic flow of a conditional statement), and she
      asked about it. The guide must have misunderstood because she seemed to go off on a tangent about
      efficiency and how web applications making handling thousands of requests at a time need to have
      condensed code. This was a perfectly valid point, but my pair got frustrated because all she
      wanted was a simple explanation.
    <p>
      As for feedback, I can't remember a time where I was nervous to receive it. I told myself from the
      very beginning that it's all about how I choose to take the feedback. Even if somebody writes
      something that I don't agree with, I should at least consider it and see if I can use it to make
      myself better. It turns out that almost all the feedback I've received so far has been helpful.
      It's good to know how other people perceive you. The most practical piece I've received is that
      I don't need to comment my code so much unless it's overly-complicated. I can include these
      comments in my pseudocode instead. Since the goal is the write code that's easy to follow, we
      generally shouldn't need a comment. I intend on incorporating that feedback in to my remaining
      assignments. She also challenged me to go further with my solution. In Ruby, there are so many
      built-in methods that can really condense common constructs such as loops. While still timeboxing,
      I intend on considering alternative solutions as best I can.
    <p>
      Writing feedback is actually more difficult than I thought it would be. I found that unless I was
      consciouslly thinking about the feedback during the pairing session, then I had trouble actually
      giving constructive feedback. Most of what I remember about the sessions is positive, so I've been
      trying to keep at least one thing in mind that my pair can work on so they can improve. My lowest
      marks in my meta feedback have come from not being actionable enough, and I completely agree. This
      happened on the pairing session where I genuinely could not think of anything constructive to say.
      In my following sessions, I'm going to try and write down a few keywords or notes that will help
      trigger a talking point on the feedback I write.
