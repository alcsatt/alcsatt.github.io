      Although I haven't actually asked any questions on our Google+ group -- one word immediately comes to
      mind: specificity. The more specific a question is, the more likely I am to both read it and replicate
      it. By taking the time to make a question concise and specific, it shows that the asker values both his
      time and the time of the people who may potentially help him. Questions usually come up as a result of
      confusion or a problem that one is having. Something important to include in your question is the
      <em>context</em>. The more the asker can describe their situation or their line of thinking -- the better
      chance that somebody will be able to guide you in the proper direction. Explaining what you were doing
      when you encountered a problem and any of the roadblocks that prevented you from solving the problem
      really help to paint a bigger picture. The problem may stem from a lack of understanding in another area
      as opposed to one related to that particular question.
    <p>
      This may be a short post, but asking good questions really comes down to respect for your potential
      readers. Try to be as clear and concise as possible. Utilize proper grammar and punctuation. Always be
      specific.
