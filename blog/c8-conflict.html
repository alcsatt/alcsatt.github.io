      After actually thinking about and talking through this, I'm sure it will reinforce how petty this
      conflict was in the first place, but it's always good to remind myself so I can stay humble and try
      to keep my emotions in check. I've had plenty of more deep conflicts, but for the purposes of sharing
      on the Internet, I'll stick to something a little less personal.
    <p>
      For what ever reason, the following was on of the first situations that came to my mind. Every Thursday
      night, I practice with my tennis team. This has been happening for the last eight years or so. We all
      have a good time and we really just enjoy the exercise. Several years ago, I must have been having a
      really bad day because I overreacted to something that normally would have never bothered me. I was
      playing doubles on a court. We were having some good points and good exchanges, but one of my opponents
      (who is on my team, but we're practicing against each other) kept lobbing these really high shots and
      not taking the points seriously. These shots aren't illegal, but there is a certain etiquette in tennis
      and he was well aware of it, and I knew he was capable of actually hitting better shots. I felt like
      he was just doing it on that particular night to get on my nerves. I started to make passive aggressive
      comments, and I think he enjoyed the fact that he was getting in my head because he kept doing it over
      and over again. Eventually I just got fed up with the whole thing because it felt like I wasn't getting
      a good workout in at all and I wasn't enjoying it. He questioned me when I left and then I just exploded.
      I told him he was wasting my time and he was only doing it because he knew I found it annoying. He just
      laughed at me which made me more angry. I ended up storming off the court and leaving practice.
    <p>
      We always go to a sports bar after practice to grab some food and drinks. I thought about not going at
      all that night, but I decided to listen to my stomach instead and go apologize so I could get something
      to eat. I ended up just telling him that I was sorry and I shouldn't have reacted like I did. He
      understood and all was forgiven. If I could do it all over again, I probably should have taken it as a
      good opportunity to better my mental game rather than my actually tennis shots. The mental battles in
      tennis can be quite exhausting so it's good to have to endure people trying to get in your head and
      irritate you. I just remember feeling like he didn't respect me at the time and he didn't want me to
      get better at tennis. Had I been more mature, I would have been able to shrug it off and not react like
      I did.
    <p>
      This experience taught me a lot. It was a simple situation, but how I reacted to it was really
      eye-opening. It disturbed me how easily he had manipulated my emotions. How would I react in the
      professional world if someone got under my skin. Everyone has to deal with things that irritate them
      on a daily basis, but we have the power to not let them affect us so negatively. I take it as a
      challenge. Each time I am able to keep my cool and learn something -- I benefit and I set an example
      for others.
