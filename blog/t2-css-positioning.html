  <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
  <h2>Differences between Relative, Absolute and Fixed</h2>
  <h4><em>March 29, 2015</em></h4>

      CSS positioning plays a crucial role in the overall look and feel of a webpage. As you continue
      to add content to your website, knowing how to tell that content where to sit on the page is a
      very useful skill!
    </p>
    <p>
        The standard behavior for HTML content (without applying any CSS) is to flow lower down the
        page. If you add one HTML block (let's say it's just a paragraph), then you add another one
        below it in the code -- that's exactly how the paragraphs will appear on the webpage. The
        paragraph you wrote first will appear higher on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Relative Positioning</b> allows you to shift the element around (by adjusting the top,
        right, bottom or left attribute in CSS) to a different area than where it would have been if
        you had kept the normal flow. Since you can specify that you want to use relative positioning
        for a specific element, it does not affect the position of the other elements.
        For example, let's say that I want to shift a paragraph over to the right from where it would
        have been originally. All I have to do is add the following to the CSS file I have linked:

    <xmp>
      p {
        position: relative;
        left: 2em;
      }
    </xmp>
    <p>
        <b>Absolute Positioning</b> allows you to take an element out of its normal flow. An element
        is positioned in relation to it's containing element (let's say it's a h1 header):

    <xmp>
      h1 {
        position: absolute;
        left: 2em;
        top: 0px;
        width: 200px;
      }
    </xmp>
    <p>
      The above sample code sets the position of the h1 element to absolute and moves it 2em from the left
      side of the page. It sits at the very top of the page and is 200 pixels wide.
    <p>
        <b>Fixed Positioning</b> allows you to take an element out of its normal flow. The positioning
        is done in relation to the browser window itself. Have you
        ever wanted to create one of those navigation bars on the side of the page that stays in the
        same position now matter how much you scroll around? That's exactly what setting the position
        attribute to fixed does. All of the other elements behave as if that element is not even
        there. They ignore the space the element would have taken up. If set the position attribute to
        fixed in the code above, then that header would move all the way down the page with you -- no
        matter where you went!
