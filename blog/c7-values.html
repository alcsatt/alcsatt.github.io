  <h2>Exploring My Values</h2>
  <h4><em>May 3, 2015</em></h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Although it's difficult to narrow down all of my values. I'm going to at least try and explore a few
      that are the most important to me. The scales represent whether or not I agree that I am living
      up to these values:
      <p>
      <b>Empathy</b><br/>
      Disagree &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - - - - - 2 - - - - - 3 - - - - - 4 - - - - - <b>5</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agree
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Friendships</b><br/>
      Disagree &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - - - - - 2 - - - - - 3 - - - - - <b>4</b> - - - - - 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agree
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Helping others</b><br/>
      Disagree &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - - - - - 2 - - - - - <b>3</b> - - - - - 4 - - - - - 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agree
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <b>Inner harmony</b><br/>
      Disagree &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - - - - - <b>2</b> - - - - - 3 - - - - - 4 - - - - - 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Agree
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I would talk about any of the first three, but I guess I want to focus on inner harmony because this is
      my personal blog and it's the rating that I graded myself the harshest on. I do wonder if it's a
      coincidence that the order I thought of them in had to do with how well I thought I was living up to
      them subconsciously. Inner harmony is perhaps the most important thing to me because I feel like to be
      in a state of true inner harmony, that's when (to put it as simply as I can) you have reached a "5" on
      every other one of your values. That's the ultimate goal for me. To not have any turmoil, and to not
      second guess myself -- to just be in a state of total bliss -- I can think of nothing better.
    <p>
      Most of the time when people ask me for advice, it has to do with friendships or figuring out how someone
      else is feeling. This type of advice all has to do with my first three values. People ask for that type
      of advice because they want to help someone.
    <p>
      I think I can leverage these values if I'm feeling down on myself or experiencing some type of stereotype
      threat. In fact, I may even be able to better live up to these values if I help other people who are
      also experiencing sterotype threats but are unsure of what to do. This may sound selfish, but I always
      feel better when I try to help someone else fix their problems. Often, it makes my own problems seem
      insignificant and help me gain a perspective. If I focus on someone else for a little while, it usually
      helps me calm down and regain a clear head. I have no doubt that I'll run in to these situations while
      in a totally new city and at DBC. I really do need to come back and read these while I'm on campus.
      To actually read what I've written down from a time past would go a long way to ground me when I feel
      like I'm floating away.
