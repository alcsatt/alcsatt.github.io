  <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
  <h2>What Are They?</h2>
  <h4><em>April 5, 2015</em></h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      <b>Arrays</b> are like ordered lists. Each entry can be referenced by a number (also called
      an <em>index</em>). The actual value at each entry is up to you. It can be simple like a grocery
      list:
      <p><code>grocery_list = ["eggs", "milk", "vegetables", "fruits"]</code></p>
      <p>They can contain numbers or even other arrays as their entries. Instead of something general
        like "fruits" or "vegetables", I could have chosen to make those sub-lists within my larger
        grocery list:
        <p><code>grocery_list = ["eggs", "milk", ["carrots", "peas", "green beans"], ["apples,
          oranges, bananas"]]</p>
          <p> Let's say that you didn't want to have to scan through the entire list to find something.
            You just want to know what the second entry is. Here is how you would access it:
            <p><code>grocery_list[1] #this would give you "milk"</code></p>
            <p>You may be wondering why I didn't use "2" for the index to get the second entry. This
              is a great question. It's important to note that the indexes of arrays start with zero.
              That means the first entry is:
              <p><code>grocery_list[0]</code></p>
          <p>You can even choose to start from the last entry in the list:
            <code>grocery_list[-1]</code>
        <p>Once you have a much longer list -- you can do really cool things like printing out the
          whole thing. Imagine you have a list of numbers, but you realized that as you were typing
          it out you were off by one on each and every one of them. You might think that's not a big
          deal because I can just start over. What if it was a list of a hundred numbers? A thousand?
          Wouldn't you rather just do something like this?
          <p><code>my_huge_list_of_numbers.map{ |number| number + 1}</code></p>
          <p>Now all your numbers have been adjusted!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can think of a <b>hash</b> as a dictionary. What's one of the distinguishing factors of a
        dictionary? You look up a keyword and you get a definition or value for that keyword. That's
        exactly what you can do with hashes. Let's say you wanted to keep track of a bunch of contact
        information about someone. Sure, you could do it in an array. Would you really want to
        remember that their hometown is the fourth entry or their birthday is the fifth entry?
        Wouldn't it be easier if you could just ask your program what hometown this person is from
        and you could get that value? I sure would! Let's see how we can do that with a hash:
        <p>
        <code>contact_info {</code><br/>
        <code>&nbsp;:first_name => "John",</code><br/>
        <code>&nbsp;:middle_name => "Albert",</code><br/>
        <code>&nbsp;:last_name => "Doe",</code><br/>
        <code>&nbsp;:hometown => "Miami",</code><br/>
        <code>&nbsp;:birthday => "January 5, 1990",</code><br/>
        <code>&nbsp;:age => 25</code><br/>
        <code>}</code></p>
        <p>Now when you want to access the person's hometown you can just say <code>contact_info[:hometown]</code> and you'll get "Miami". Hashes, in my opinion, provide a far more
          organized way to look at you data. I always prefer remembering the keys because they make
          more logical sense (the programmer has the ability to define them). As a result, looking
          up data is far more intuitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have only touched on these concepts and their uses. I hope that you feel even a little more
        confident about the similarities and differences between these two containers after reading
        this. There is far more that you can do with both of them!
