  <h2>Stereotype Threats</h2>
  <h4><em>April 26, 2015</em></h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Stereotype threats are a very interesting notion that I've never actually had explicitly defined.
      You can go in to more detail about them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat">
      here.</a> They basically exist because someone is afraid of doing something that would confirm
      a negative stereotype about themselves. I saw how this would apply to other groups (particularly
      races) immediately, but as a white male in his twenties, I had a little more trouble thinking
      about it. After some thought, I feel like I've come up with something.
    <p>
      In the past, I've been
      afraid of underperforming in academics and athletics because of a stereotype that most white
      males are privileged. I remember consciouslly thinking to myself in some situations: "People
      are going to look down on me if I don't go to a great college after getting so many opportunities
      and going to great prep schools growing up." It's a constant fear -- not being good enough and
      being worried about what other people think of me. I don't expect the fear to ever go away, but I
      do expect myself to have the courage to overcome it. When I do that, I'll be a better person. This
      is particularly important in a program like DBC. I come from a background in Computer Science so
      I definitely have some fears about how people will perceive me if I don't know the answer to a
      problem. I feel like people assume that anyone who has a Computer Science degree should just fly
      right through all this material. If I worry about that, it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
      If I don't know something and someone else does, I'll learn from it. The next time the same problem
      comes up, I'll make it my goal to know the answer. In this way, I hope to provide a good example
      for others. I need to own my knowledge and use it to help teach people.
