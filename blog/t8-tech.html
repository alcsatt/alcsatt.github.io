  <h1>NoSQL Databases</h1>
  <h2>Adapting to Keep Up with Modern Applications</h2>
  <h4><em>May 10, 2015</em></h4>

    <p>
      SQL databases and NoSQL databases both have their trade-offs, but this post is intended to at least
      provide a high level understanding of what a NoSQL database is. SQL databases were developed in the
      1970s while NoSQL databases were developed in the 2000s. You may have guessed just by reading that
      last sentence that there were very different needs at the time of their development so there are bound
      to be differences in design. You're absolutely correct.
    <p>
      The real advantage of NoSQL databases comes from their ability to handle large volumes of data and
      data manipulation very efficiently. They were developed with modern applications in mind and take
      advantage of the cheap storage and vast processing power. They scale "horizontally" which basically
      means that when you have too much data and you want to expand -- you add servers instead of adding
      more resources to a single server. They usually support something called auto-sharding which means
      that they inherently know how to spread data across several servers. Load balancers automatically
      distribute the data and queries so as to not unfairly burden individual servers with a lot of work.
      It also provides another failsafe because if a server crashes, you still have the remaining servers
      that can continue to support your application.
    <p>
      Again this is just meant as an introduction. Let's go over some of the differences between SQL databases
      and NoSQL databases. There are several different types of NoSQL databases (key-value stores, document
      databases, wide-column stores and graph databases) whereas there is just on type of SQL database. SQL
      databases use tables, rows and columns to store information about entities. You then need to join the
      tables together to acquire more complex datasets. NoSQL databases store their information in different
      ways depending on their type. Key-values stores use (you guessed it) two columns -- a key and a value.
      Document databases (such as MongoDB) store all relevant data together in something called a "document."
      The advantage here is that this approach is not dependent on a schema. This means that you can store
      data with different structures together (unlike rows in SQL databases which adhere to a template). The
      documents can also be stored in JSON or another useful format that is in prominent use for modern web
      applications. As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, SQL databases scale vertically. This means that
      you must keep adding resources on to a single server in order to accommodate increasing data demand. It
      is not impossible to have them scale horizontally, but it requires a significant engineering committment.
      NoSQL databases scale horizontally. You can add more servers or instances on the cloud and the data
      automatically spreads and re-distributes to the new servers. The last difference I'll mention has to do
      with actually manipulating the data. In SQL, you have to use a specific language (SELECT, INSERT, JOIN,
      FROM, WHERE, etc...) to create queries that act on the data. In NoSQL databases, however, there are
      object-oriented APIs which do this.
