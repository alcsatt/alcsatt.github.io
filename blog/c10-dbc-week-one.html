  <h1>DBC Phase One</h1>
  <h2>Week One</h2>

    <p>
      This week was a whirlwind. When I think about where I was a week ago today -- I'm amazed at how much
      has happened. I arrived in New York City for the first time in my life (at age 27). I met my roommate,
      we explored the surrounding area in Fort Greene, Brooklyn (where we're staying). We then ventured in to
      Manhattan and explored. I was a little underwhelmed by Brooklyn. Based on what everyone had told me about
      Manhattan, I was expecting to feel like my personal space was being violated constantly. After a week
      here, I can say that's not the case at all. It may have something to do with summer and people leaving
      the city, but everything feels so open and spread out just because of how vast it all is. Everyone does
      their own thing.
    <p>
      As for DBC itself, it has certainly been a roller coaster. Monday almost drained me to the point where
      I didn't want to do the program anymore. We met so many people and I was taking in so many new things
      at once about the way they live life there, then we had to code after about eight hours of introductions.
      Every day after that got a little better. I started to get my comfortable with the people around me and
      I started to form some rituals for my days. I had great pairing experiences (particularly with Lowell)
      and I particularly enjoyed the four person group project we did Friday to write a program that solves
      Sudoku boards. I wasn't sure how our personalities would mix, but after we got over a few initial road
      bumps -- we (Tom, Joseph and Julia) worked very well together. We were even the first ones to get a
      working solution. The moment that made me happiest this week was when I saw Lowell and his two partners
      struggling (they were the only group of three). They were all mentally and emotionally drained from the
      week. I decided to offer to coach them a little so they felt like they got something technically out of
      the day. Lowell and Jonathan in particular were very grateful to me. It made me realize how much I love
      to help people and to teach them what ever I can.
    <p>
      I'm sure I'll have horrible days at some point with the code where all I want to do is leave and give up.
      When and if that day comes, I hope I'll have the strength to recognize what is happening, really lean in
      to my failure and truly learn something from it.
