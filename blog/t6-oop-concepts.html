  <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
  <h2>Different Kinds and Where To Use Them</h2>
  <h4><em>April 26, 2015</em></h4>

  <section>
    <p>
      Variable scope is an important concept that every novice developer should learn. Today, I'll be
      talking about this concept as it applies to Ruby. There are five different types of variables in
      Ruby. Global variables (which start with $), class variables (which start with @@), instance
      variables (which start with @), local variables and constants.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Global</b> variables can be seen and altered by anything and anyone. It is usually not
      recommended to use this type of variable as it could produce unintended side effects as your
      code base grows. For the sake of completeness, it's still good to know what they are in case you
      ever encounter one: <br/>
      <xmp>
        $i_am_a_global_variable = 42

        class SomeClass
          def do_something
            $i_am_a_global_variable = 12
          end
        end

        class AnotherClass
          def print_fourty_two
            puts "I love the number #{$i_am_a_global_variable}."
          end
        end

        someclass = SomeClass.new
        someclass.do_something  # did we mean to do that?

        anotherclass = AnotherClass.new
        anotherclass.print_fourty_two   #uhhhhh this didn't print 42
      </xmp>
    <p>
    As you can see, using a global variable may have unintended consequences. We wrote a method expecting
    it to print 42, but we instead got 12 because our first class altered the variable's value.
    <p>
        <b>Class</b> variables are useful because they can be shared across all instances of a class.
        Let's say we wanted to keep track of the number of cars in our inventory. We could do that
        with a class variable: <br/>

        <xmp>
          class Car
            @@car_count = 0
            MAKE = "Honda"
            def initialize(model, year)
              @model = model
              @year = year
            end

            def total_count
              @@car_count += 1
              total_msg = "We have #{@@car_count} car(s)."
            end
          end

          car1 = Car.new("Accord", 2004)
          car2 = Car.new("CR-V", 2010)

          car1.total_count  # "We have 1 car(s)."
          car2.total_count  # "We have 2 car(s)."
        </xmp>
    <p>
      We have our class variable called car_count which gets incremented every time we call the
      total count method.
    <p>
      <b>Instance</b> variables are very common. They are unique to the instance of that class. This
      is useful for keeping track of specific information about an object. In the above example, model
      and year are both instance variables. If we printed them out for our car1 object, we would get
      "Accord" and "2004". Similarly, if we printed them out for our car2 object, we would get "CR-V"
      and "2010".
    <p>
      <b>Local</b> variables are also quite common. They begin with a lowercase letter or an underscore.
      The actual scope of a local variable can be anywhere from a module all the way down to a block.
      In the above example, the local variable (although not really needed) total_msg is local to the
      total_count method inside the Car class. In other words, I cannot manipulate or reference that
      variable anywhere but inside that method.
    <p>
      <b>Constants</b> by begin with an uppercase letter, but are usually in all caps by convention.
      They can be defined inside a class (or module). After that, altering the value of that constant
      will give you a warning. Constants must also be initialized with a value or you will receive
      an error. In the above example, I created a constant MAKE to show that we're at a Honda
      dealership. There is no need to ever have the MAKE variable be anything else. If I wanted to
      make the Car class a little more generic, I could have a make instance variable that I could set
      upon creation of a car object.
